# THP Next Project : RPG in JavaScript

In this project, we will design a simple RPG (Role Playing Game) where several characters fight each other.

## Specifications

A class character with :
- Name
- Health Points (hp)
- Damage inflicted to opponents (dmg)
- Mana points (mana) : allow the character to use special skills
- Status

Classes :
- Fighter
- Paladin
- Monk
- Berzerker
- Assassin

They each have their own characteristic and a special skill unique to their class.

The game end in 10 turns. In each turn, the user will play each character by choosing an action.

When a character dies, the attacker receive 20 mana points.

The winner is the one with the most HP at the end of the 10 turns, or when only one character is left.

## How to use

Open the HTML file in your favorite browser and follow the steps.
